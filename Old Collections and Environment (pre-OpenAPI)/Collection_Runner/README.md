# The Collection Runner feature within Postman is a simple way to loop or create iterations for different API calls, with the ability to use an input file (a CSV of users in our example here)

For all examples here, it is assumed you are using the existing **Postman environment** from [the main repo here](https://github.com/PaloAltoNetworks/pcs-postman)

There are also 2 docs directly from Postman that outline similar scenarios of how to generically use Collection Runner to loop through iterations. 

1. [Looping through a Data File](https://blog.postman.com/looping-through-a-data-file-in-the-postman-collection-runner/)

1. [Working with data files, ramen example](https://documenter.getpostman.com/view/1559645/RVu4GVAs)

## There is a separate Collection specific to each use-case, but almost (if not all) will just be leveraging existing API calls from [the main repo here](https://github.com/PaloAltoNetworks/pcs-postman)
